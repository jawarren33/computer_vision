#In this function, we assume that x and y are tensors representing the content for the first and second grids, respectively. 
#The tensors have shapes (batch_size, height, width, channels), where batch_size is the number of samples in the batch, height and width are the dimensions of the grids, and channels is the number of channels in the content.

#The function uses the tf.tile operation to tile the contents of x and y. We tile x and y to double the height and width of each grid. Then, we concatenate the tiled contents into a pair of grids, where the top-left quadrant contains x tiled twice and the bottom-right quadrant contains y tiled twice.
#Finally, the function returns the grids tensor with shape (batch_size, height*2, width*2, channels), which contains the tiled grids.
