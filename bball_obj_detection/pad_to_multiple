#In this function, tensor is the input tensor that needs to be padded, and multiple is the desired multiple for padding. 
#The function computes the padding amount for each dimension by calculating the difference between the closest higher multiple of multiple and the shape of the tensor.

#The tf.pad operation is then used to pad the tensor with zeros. The padding is applied symmetrically to the top and bottom dimensions and the left and right dimensions.

#Finally, the padded tensor is returned as the output.
