#In this code, we assume you have a pre-trained object detection model saved in a TensorFlow SavedModel format. 
#You can load the model using tf.saved_model.load by providing the path to the model directory.
#Next, we set a confidence threshold to filter the detected objects based on their confidence scores. 
#Objects with scores below the threshold will be ignored.
#We open the video file using OpenCV and iterate over its frames. For each frame, we preprocess it, convert it to a TensorFlow tensor, and perform object detection using the loaded model. 
#The detections returned by the model are then filtered based on the confidence threshold.
#You can process the filtered detections as needed, such as drawing bounding boxes around the detected basketballs or performing additional analysis.
#Finally, we display the frame with the detections using OpenCV's imshow function. The loop continues until the video ends or the 'q' key is pressed.
#Make sure to replace the "path/to/pretrained/model" with the actual path to your pre-trained object detection model, and "path/to/video/file.mp4" with the actual path to your video file.

#Note: The exact implementation and model selection may vary depending on the specific object detection model you're using. 
#You might need to adjust the code accordingly to match the requirements of your chosen model.
