# Step 1: Prepare the data
# - Collect or generate a labeled dataset of videos representing different actions
# - Preprocess the videos by resizing, normalizing, and extracting frames or clips

# Step 2: Data preprocessing
# - Extract frames or clips from the videos
# - Apply any necessary transformations (e.g., resizing, normalization)

# Step 3: Model architecture
# - Define the architecture of your action recognition model using TensorFlow or OpenCV
# - You can use pre-trained models (such as CNNs or RNNs) or build your own model
# - Consider temporal modeling techniques like 3D convolutions or recurrent layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Define your model layers here
    # ...

    # Temporal modeling layers (e.g., 3D convolutions or recurrent layers)
    # ...
])

# Step 4: Data splitting
# - Split your dataset into training and testing/validation sets

# Step 5: Model training
# - Train the model using the training set
# - Specify the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics
# - Choose an appropriate number of epochs and batch size

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_videos, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(val_videos, val_labels))

# Step 6: Model evaluation
# - Evaluate the trained model on the testing/validation set using the evaluate() function
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_videos, test_labels)

# Step 7: Model inference
# - Load and preprocess new videos or frames for inference
# - Use the trained model to predict the action label

# Example inference on a single video frame
frame = cv2.imread('path/to/frame.jpg')
preprocessed_frame = preprocess(frame)
predictions = model.predict(np.expand_dims(preprocessed_frame, axis=0))

# Step 8: Post-processing
# - Interpret the model predictions and take further actions (e.g., decision-making)

# Example post-processing
action_label = np.argmax(predictions)
confidence = np.max(predictions)
print("Predicted action:", action_label)
print("Confidence:", confidence)
