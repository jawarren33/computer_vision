import tensorflow as tf

# Step 1: Prepare the data
# - Load and preprocess your training data
# - Split the data into training and validation sets

# Step 2: Define the model architecture
# - Create the model using TensorFlow's API (e.g., Sequential, Functional, or Subclassing API)
# - Add layers, activations, and other components to define the model architecture

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Define your layers here
    # ...
])

# Step 3: Configure the training process
# - Define loss function, optimizer, and metrics
# - Choose an appropriate learning rate and other hyperparameters

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
metrics = ['accuracy']

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=metrics)

# Step 4: Train the model
# - Use the fit() function to train the model on your training data
# - Specify the number of epochs and batch size

num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32

model.fit(
    x=train_images,
    y=train_labels,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    epochs=num_epochs,
    validation_data=(val_images, val_labels)
)

# Step 5: Evaluate the model
# - Use the evaluate() function to evaluate the trained model on your test or validation data

test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)

# Step 6: Save the trained model
# - Save the trained model for future use or deployment

model.save("path/to/save/model.h5")
